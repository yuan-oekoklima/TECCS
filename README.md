# TECCS - Twig Experiment Climate Change Simulator


A shiny app to simulate timing of phenological phases based on chilling forcing relationships from user's own experimental data.

The app is available at [https://oekoklima.shinyapps.io/twig_shiny/](https://oekoklima.shinyapps.io/twig_shiny/) and soon at [BAYSICS](https://www.baysics.de).

The repository here holds the source code.

It is also possible to run the app locally on your computer. For this you need [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). Once in RStudio you need to create a new project, select *Version Control*, then *Git* and then put in the URL of this repo: https://github.com/yuan-oekoklima/TECCS

RStudio will then fetch the code from GitHub. Afterwards you can open the file `app.R` directly in RStudio, and press the Button *Run App*. Most likely you will need to install some R packages before, but you will see a prompt or notification for that.


The app was created by [Ye Yuan](https://www.oekoklimatologie.wzw.tum.de/index.php?id=235&L=1) with contributions from [Michael Matiu](https://github.com/mitmat/) and [Annette Menzel](https://www.oekoklimatologie.wzw.tum.de/en/staff/prof-dr-a-menzel/).
